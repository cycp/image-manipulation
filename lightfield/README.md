# Lightfield Camera:
Depth Refocusing and Aperture Adjustment with Light Field Data

## Overview

In this project we demonstrate how capturing multiple images over a plane can lead to cool post-processing effects like depth refocusing and aperture adjustment. We show how this works by using image datasets from the Stanford Light Archive to demonstrate that we can achieve these effects simply with a few operations!
