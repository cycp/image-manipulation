# Final Project: Fake Miniatures & Vertigo Shot

## Fake Miniatures

We create fake miniatures by simulating the effect of selective focus cameras (Tilt Shift), effectively narrowing the depth of field to create the illusion of being extremely close to the subject.

## Vertigo Shot

In this project, we attempt to replicate the 'Dolly Zoom' effect, also known as the Vertigo Shot. We do this by taking a sequence of photos of a single subject, backing away from the subject but increasing the zoom each time so as to keep the subject centered and a constant size throughout the sequence. I used a Canon Rebel XT DSLR camera and chose objects around my apartment. I found that the most difficult part was to keep the object centered and in the same position. I think this would have been easier with a tripod, but I did not have access to one. I think the Dolly Zoom effect is best seen with images where there are objects in the background, because this emphasizes the changing background which contrasts with the constant foreground subject.
