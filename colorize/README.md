# Colorizing Prokudin-Gorskii's Photo Collection

Colorizing Prokudin-Gorskii's glass plate images via aligining the RGB channels. Also includes automatic cropping and contrasting.

## Overview

Files included: 
```
main.m
align.m
pyramid.m
crop.m
```

## How to Run

Run the main.m file and it will call the other functions as needed. To colorize a specific photograph, simply enter the name of the file containing the glass plate scans into the imname variable, for example:
```
imname = 'settlers.jpg';
```

## Tips

If auto-cropping/auto-contrasting are not needed, I recommend that you comment those lines of code out to make the program as a whole run faster and save time.
